    "> - Delta Lake: An open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads.\n",
    "> - MLflow: An open-source platform for the complete machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a central model registry.\n",
    "> - Koalas: A Python library that provides a pandas-like API on top of Apache Spark, making it easier to transition from small-scale data processing to large-scale data processing.\n",
